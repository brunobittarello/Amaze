# Amaze
Amaze mobile game remake using Unity.  
It is not finished but it is functional. I only used the standard assets. For the gameplay side, I think the only features missing are the Hint and multiple balls.  

I tried to create a random stage generator, but it was not good enough. My first approach was better than the others ones I tried. I started with random lines while keeping wall after it finished, but the levels were not fun. After I tried rectangles and nodes, none was good.  

After 9 hours, after months where I didnt opened the unity, this result is good enough for me. I don't like this game that much to keep improving it.  
Feel free to copy or fork it.
